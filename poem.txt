The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
It's raining cats and dogs, cats and dogs everywhere!
I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream!
The sun shines brightly in the summer sky, summer sky brings joy.
